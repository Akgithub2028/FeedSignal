# Directory guide: `services/backend-api/tests/fixtures`

**Baseline:** `93359c4a2bf20310f98e42d570de50a1586812d8` · **Updated:** 2026-10-06 · **Product:** FeedSignal

## Purpose and boundary

Automated tests and supporting fixtures for this service/feature. Read the fixtures, imports, test names, and assertions to learn intended boundaries; presence of a test file does not establish that it currently passes.

This directory has 1 immediate baseline/preparation files, 2 child directories, and 7 files in its subtree before generated guides/index inventories. Common formats: .csv: 3, .jsonl: 2, .json: 1, .py: 1.

## Read first

- [copilot_actions_item.json](<copilot_actions_item.json>) — Configuration or structured fixture; inspect named settings and consumers before changing it. Secret values must remain outside tracked configuration.

## Files, children, and contracts

[Complete file inventory](<../../../../docs/DIRECTORY_FILE_INDEX.md>) lists every baseline/preparation file by directory; [guide index](<../../../../docs/DIRECTORY_GUIDE_INDEX.md>) links every child and sibling guide.

Direct children: [embedding_eval](<embedding_eval/directory.md>), [sentiment_eval](<sentiment_eval/directory.md>).

## Inputs, outputs, and change safety

Inputs include validated API/task payloads, organization-scoped database rows, and configured providers; outputs include records, normalized analysis, scheduled work, or responses. Verify organization identity in query, cache, job, and webhook paths. Preserve transactions, retry/idempotency contracts, and encrypted credential handling; workers must not assume backend imports exist.

## Verification and limits

Run the relevant existing tests from the service root using its configured dependencies. Read real assertions and fixtures; do not mark tests passing from this inventory.

This summary was generated from tracked filenames, source declarations/module documentation, and document headings/prose, then sampled for navigation quality. It is not a full semantic audit or a runtime verification. Read actual files before editing. Missing owner settings and validation evidence remain in [UNANSWERED_SECRETS.md](<../../../../UNANSWERED_SECRETS.md>).
